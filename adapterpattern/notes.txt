This design patter is great to use if you're looking to keep the codes as is but implement a new way of doing things without messing 
with the old way, the adapter is basically the class that connects your new implementation to your old implementation.  This class stores 
your original implementation, and constructs an adapter with it, in which it converts it's properties to the new object.  Therefore, everytime
a new situation arises, you'll need to create an interface and an adapter that implements that interface and stores the original object.

Look at this as a natural adapter, which is used to convert one object to another.
