The Composite Pattern allows us to build structures of objects in the form of trees that contains both composition of objects and
individual objects as nodes. Using a composite structure, we can apply the same operations over both composites and individual
objects. In other words, in most cases we can ignore the differences between compositions of objects and individual objects.
The Composite Pattern has four participants:

• Component
• Leaf
• Composite
• Client

all object extends the component, because afer all they are all components.  this design pattern is really good when trying to list 
all components with their values depending on the category they fall under.  The add method in the Collections interface for the 
java API uses this pattern.
